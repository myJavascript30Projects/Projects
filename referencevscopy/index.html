    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team); //['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'], ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team); //['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux'], ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); //copy of players
    console.log(team2); //['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux'];
    team2[3] = 'James';
    console.log(players, team2); //['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux'], ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'James'];

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
     const team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log('team 3 ', team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[4] = "new name";
    console.log(team4);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[4] = "new name";
    console.log(team4);
    console.log(players);
    //or use array.from
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    console.log(team5);
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name: "James Mitchell",
        age: 31
    };
    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    //captain.number = 99;
    // how do we take a copy instead?
                                //blank object, pass all the properties from, then fold in new properties.
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
    console.log(cap2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //object spread is not in Javascript yet so this wont pass
    //const capt3 = {...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
